# MafGame Tournament Parser & Seating Planner

## Overview
This project aims to parse participant data from the [MafGame](https://mafgame.org/) website, where tournaments for the tabletop intellectual game Mafia are published. The main challenge is to efficiently allocate tournament participants, marking pairs of players and player-judges who should not be seated together according to the game rules.

## Features
- **Participant Parsing:** Scrape and process participant data from MafGame tournaments.
- **Rule-Based Seating:** Implement logic to separate player pairs and player-judges as per tournament regulations.
- **Seating Quality Assessment:** Evaluate the seating arrangement to ensure a balanced distribution, allowing all players to equally interact with a diverse range of other participants.

## Goal
The primary objective is to create a balanced seating arrangement, ensuring fair play and optimal interaction among all players throughout the tournament.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the parsing algorithm, seating logic, or any other aspect of the project are welcome. Please feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull requests.
